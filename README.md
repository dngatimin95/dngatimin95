### Hello There and Welcome to my page! :tada:

My name is Darren and I'm currently building things that I find interesting, especially within the field of AI and ML :brain:
 - :hammer: Currently working on:
   - [ ] Training an AI to play the snake game in `pyGame_Tour` through reinforcement training
   - [ ] Figure out how to implement a GPT2 transformer and RNN to generate text in `Plot_Gen`
   - [ ] Implement a NN to make an AI optimally play Blackjack in `Blackjack`
   - [ ] Learning ins and outs of web development with Django/Node.js
   - [ ] Find out if Neural Networks dreams of electric sheep
